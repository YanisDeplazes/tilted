# tilted 

Tilted is a rhythm-based platformer in which players navigate a geometric figure through obstacles by rotating the camera, changing the direction of gravity and acceleration and requiring skill and responsiveness. The project was a digital ideation module submission that was carried out in a nine-day sprint.
